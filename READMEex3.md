Spirograph Drawing with Python Turtle
This project uses Python’s Turtle graphics library to draw a colorful spirograph — a series of overlapping circles rotated incrementally to create a geometric, flower-like pattern.

Features:

Draws multiple circles with a customizable radius.

Each circle is drawn in a random RGB color.

The turtle rotates by a fixed angle after drawing each circle to create the spirograph effect.

Adjustable parameters include the circle radius and rotation step angle.
