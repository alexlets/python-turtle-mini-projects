This project recreates a spot painting inspired by Damien Hirst using Python's turtle graphics module.

We use the colorgram package to extract a color palette from an image of a real Hirst artwork. The program then paints a 10x10 grid of colorful dots using this palette, mimicking the artist's signature style.

âœ… Key Features:
Extracts the dominant colors from an input image (image.jpg)

Filters out near-white background colors

Uses turtle to draw 100 evenly spaced colored dots

Each dot is drawn with a random color from the extracted palette

Clean grid layout using coordinate positioning (not angle-based)
