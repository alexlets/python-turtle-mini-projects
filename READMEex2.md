This project implements a random walk using Python’s Turtle graphics library. The turtle moves step-by-step in one of four directions (North, East, South, West), chosen at random each time.

Features:

Movement directions limited to 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270°.

Each step has a fixed length, ensuring consistent movement distance.

Line color changes randomly on each step, using RGB values for vibrant effects.

Line thickness gradually increases with each step, creating a dynamic visual pattern.

The turtle speed is set to maximum for fast drawing.

This exercise combines randomization, loops, and graphical output, providing practice in controlling turtle movement and visual customization.
